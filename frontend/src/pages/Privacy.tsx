                                As a zero-trust architecture platform, Nakshatra minimizes data ingestion. We do not inspect message payloads transmitted between your IoT devices and external services. Data collection is strictly limited to:

                                <li><strong>Device Telemetry:</strong> Connection statuses, latency metrics, and handshake timestamps to maintain service uptime.</li>
                                <li><strong>Account Details:</strong> Information necessary for billing, account management, and support (e.g., email address, payment details).</li>

                            <p>
                                We prioritize security over convenience. All device certificates are generated entirely on your local machine using our provisioning tools; Nakshatra operates solely with public keys.

                                Any attempt by unauthorized entities to exploit cryptographic vulnerabilities will be automatically blackholed by our edge network anomaly detection systems. Your data routing rules are immutable without explicit multi-factor authentication from your dashboard.

                            <p>
                                Transient connection logs are purged every 30 days unless a security alert is triggered, in which case logs are retained for forensic analysis. Device telemetry and activity statistics are aggregated and retained for the lifespan of your account to power your analytics dashboard.

                            <p>
                                Nakshatra will never sell your personal data or device metadata. We only share necessary metrics with integrated sub-processors (like Stripe for billing or AWS/Azure underlying infrastructure) that meet our rigorous compliance thresholds, strictly to provide the Services you have requested.

                                You have full control over your footprint. You may request a complete export of your architectural configurations and telemetry data at any time. Upon account deletion, all active routing endpoints and public keys are immediately scrubbed, and associated data is purged within 7 days from our backups.
